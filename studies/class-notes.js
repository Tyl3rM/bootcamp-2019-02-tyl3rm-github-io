// Loops: For loops often used to itterate over arrrays. Just repeating a block of code, 
// no specific link to an array. 

// Loops: While loops will run as long as the given statement is true. Must set stopping condition,
// or you'll create an infinite loop. Infinite loops will crash the computer. 

// Loops: 3 Steps to define a for loops. 1. where to strop. 2. how long should i loop. 3. what changes each time.

// Loops: 2 steps to define for in loops. 1. how will you refer to keys? 2. which object you want to loop over?

// Object Access: Objects and arrays hold value. They use curly braces to contain the key value pairs. 
// They are accessed by using square brackets or dot notation. 

// Storing Values in Collections: Objects store values in non ordered key value pairs. 
// Arrays are stored in zero indexed lists. They start at zero and go up hy one. 

// What are... properties or methods: .length is a static value for array or string values. 
// Methods are reproducable objects stored on an object. .toLowerCase() Has to be called with ()

// Properties and Methods of Collections: Arrays - .concat .includes .pop .slice .push
// Objects - .hasOwnProperty .valueOf .toString (See more on MDN) Double check all info on MDN

// Scope: Imagine nested boxes. Global, Function, if:else, and loops. Each block is a different
// scope. Blocks are ended with ; Scope determines what we have access to. 

// Scope: child scope has access to its parent scope, but not vice versa. only way to have access
// to a variable within a funciton is if you return it.  

// Scope: Global scope, function scope, block scope. Var can escape block scopes, but not function
// scopes. 

// Hoisting: var declerations and function declerations are hoisted to top of scope. Different types
// hoisted differently. Var dec. only the name is hoisted, function whole body is hoisted. @runtime

// Hoisting: var can declared anywhere, available anywhere, but doesnt have value till assigned. 
// Functions expressions are similar, except they are assigned a value at all times. 

// Variable Dec Scopes: Var can be re-assigned, in global and local scope. Let can be re-assigned, 
// but it stays within its block scope. const cant be re-assigned, and is block scoped. try to use const.
