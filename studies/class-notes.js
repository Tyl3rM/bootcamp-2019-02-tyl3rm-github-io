// For loops often used to itterate over arrrays. Just repeating a block of code, 
// no specific link to an array. 

// While loops will run as long as the given statement is true. Must set stopping condition,

// 3 Steps to define a for loops. 1. where to strop. 2. how long should i loop. 3. what changes each time.

// 2 steps to define for in loops. 1. how will you refer to keys? 2. which object you want to loop over?

// Object Access: Objects and arrays hold value. They use curly braces to contain the key value pairs. 
// They are accessed by using square brackets or dot notation. 

// Storing Values in Collections: Objects store values in non ordered key value pairs. 
// Arrays are stored in zero indexed lists. They start at zero and go up hy one. 

// What are... properties or methods: .length is a static value for array or string values. 
// Methods are reproducable objects stored on an object. .toLowerCase() Has to be called with ()

// Properties and Methods of Collections: Arrays - .concat .includes .pop .slice .push
